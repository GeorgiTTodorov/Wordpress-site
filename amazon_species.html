<h2 class="article1-title">Black-capped Squirrel Monkey</h2>
<img src="https://wildlifetrip.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/black_capped_squirrel_monkey.jpg">
<p class="article1-text">These cute little squirrel monkeys are just nine to 15 inches long! They are named after the black, circular patch of fur on the top of their heads that looks just like a hat. Black-capped squirrel monkeys have yellowish-green fur and white faces.

They lead arboreal lives, spending their time up in the canopy away from the reach of predators. Highly social creatures, these New World monkeys form groups of about 50 individuals, although their groups can have up to 550 individuals! They love to play, and communicate with one another through squawks, purrs, barks, and loud screams. </p>

<h2 class="article2-title">Black Caiman</h2>

<p class="article2-text">Black caimans are the largest alligator species on Earth. They are aquatic reptiles that live in shallow, freshwater rivers, streams, and lakes in the Amazon. Males usually measure around 13 feet, but individuals up to 16.4 feet long have been spotted! Females are slightly smaller and tend to measure some 10 feet. They can weigh anywhere between 800–1,000 pounds.

These ferocious alligators are an apex predator, meaning they hunt but aren’t hunted. They feed on fish (even piranhas) amphibians, invertebrates, insects, birds, and large mammals. If you saw one, you’d quickly recognize it because of its black, scaly skin. </p>

<h2 class="article3-title">Toucan</h2>

<p class="article3-text">These exotic birds are easily spotted by a glance at their long, colorful beaks. From beak to tail they measure some 25 inches, but nearly half of that is just beak! They have black plumage on their bodies, white throat feathers and a mix of short black, red, and white tail feathers.

Their beak is bright orange, with a strip of red along the top and bottom and a black patch on the end of their top beak. It’s still a mystery why these birds have evolved such extravagant beaks, perhaps it’s to alure partners or for self-defense. They also use them to pick and peel fruit; figs are some of their favorites!</p>

<h2 class="article4-title">Pink River Dolphin</h2>
<img src="https://wildlifetrip.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pink_river_dolphin.jpg">
<p class="article4-text">The pink river dolphin is one of just five freshwater dolphin species left on Earth, and it’s the largest of the five! They are named after their light pink coloring, but did you know that they are born gray and get their pink hue later on? Males are also more pink than females.

They aren’t just the largest freshwater dolphin species; they also have the largest brains of the bunch. It is estimated they have 40% more brain capacity than humans. They can grow to nine feet long and like to chat to one another using high-frequency clicks. Pink river dolphins eat over 53 species of fish, including piranhas! </p>

<h2 class="article5-title">Capybara</h2>
<img src="https://wildlifetrip.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/capybara.jpg">
<p class="article5-text">Capybaras are the world’s largest rodents. They are quite peculiar looking and have partially webbed feet. They live on riverbanks, near ponds or in marshy, boggy landscapes. It’s essential for a capybara to be by a source of water, where they can munch on nearby water plants and keep their skin from drying out with periodical swims.

These large rodents use their sharp, overgrown front teeth to cut grasses and water plants as they graze. They can eat up to eight pounds worth of vegetation in a day! They live in groups of about 10 individuals and are always on the look-out for jaguars.</p>

<h2 class="article6-title">Puma</h2>
<img src="https://wildlifetrip.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/puma.jpg">
<p class="article6-text">Pumas are also called cougars, panthers, or mountain lions. In fact, these animals have 40 names in English alone and hold the Guiness record for the animal with the most names! An adult puma weighs about 136 pounds.

These predatorial carnivores hunt their own food, mostly at night or in the early hours of the morning. These agile hunters can leap up to 25 feet in a chase. They eat small mammals that they kill with a deadly bite to the back of the neck. It can take them a week or more to eat their catch, so they hide it out of sight in-between meals.</p>
